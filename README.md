# Recruitment and Retainment of an Essential Workforce

This was a project for the Early Childhood Project that is currently pending publication. The goal of this project was to better understand how to recruit and retain a high-quality early care and education workforce in Montana. Initial data collection was through a survey distributed to Early Childhood Project Registry members, additional data was also collected from the Early Childhood Project Registry database, as well as a follow-up focus group. Variables examined include demographics, education levels, financial incentives, wages and benefits, and future plans and goals. Results were analyzed and recommendations proposed.
